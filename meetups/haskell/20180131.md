## Data analysis with monoids

The talk was about explaining monoids and what can we do with them. The speaker picked his sources from an 
[article](https://twdkz.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/data-analysis-with-monoids/). He added some 
[maths explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Definition) about monoid to his presentation.
 
**Personal thought:** 
I won't paraphrase the article, but it was a really interesting talk to (begin to) understand what is a monoid and how 
can it be used. :smile: 

## Lazy evaluation and its traps

That talk was more technique. Haskell is a [lazy language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation). And it can 
create unexpected behaviors. For example, the speaker took a list with 10^9 integer and tried to sum them. Being lazy,
Haskell uses a lot of memory cause it keeps a lot of [thunks](https://wiki.haskell.org/Thunk). To reduce a list there
are [three ways](https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldr_Foldl_Foldl') in Haskell. The interesting part is that `foldl'` is 
strict : it does not keep thunks in memory. That is possible because it uses the 
[bang operator](https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance/Strictness#Evaluating_expressions_strictly).  
The sources used for the talk come from the book [Haskell High performance programming](http://amzn.eu/fXjSrv3)

During Q&A, they talked about [Tail call recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) which can help too when 
recurring a lot. They also mentioned [Hlint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint) that can detect some misused of
`foldr`.  
As in every language, performance problems should be handled when they appear and not before they occur.

**Personal thought:** 
The talk was really interesting. I did not used Haskell enough to see all problems linked with a lazy language. It seems
to be rarely a problem though and I enable the possibility to use infinite lists. :flushed:
