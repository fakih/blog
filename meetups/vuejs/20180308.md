# [Vue.js Paris #13, Server Side Rendering, State Animations et Typescript](https://www.meetup.com/Vuejs-Paris/events/248092630/)

## Typescript

The speaker talked about how typescript can interact with VueJs to ease your development flow. To setup a project with
typescript and webpack, the documentation on internet is really good (for example [Microsoft's one](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter)).
To use Typescript with VueJs, [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) can help. Jsx works 
with typescript and produces [Tsx](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html). The speaker recommended using 
[Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) with [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
For the negative side, the speaker told that type inference has limited support for now, but it is going to change in the
future. There is no props validation at compile time.
But Typescript is easy to setup and easy to rollback if it does not fit your needs. 

## Server side rendering

The talk is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q_dCpqDfN4).  
[Official documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) is really close from the talk.

That talk presented how to achieve universal application with VueJs. The main benefits over a simple SPA are the 
following ([For more details](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/#why-ssr)) :
* Better SEO and social sharing
* Faster time to content
* Save server resources

The speaker gives some hints about server side rendering and some traps that you can fall into while trying to setup it.
He presented [Nuxt.Js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) that solve lots of problems and help you avoid those traps. He 
also talked about [awesome-nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt-community/awesome-nuxt) : a curator for things related to 
Nuxt.js. 
He also talked about [vue-no-ssr](https://github.com/egoist/vue-no-ssr) that can help when you want to work with parts
that cannot be server side rendered. 

**Takeover :** Official documentation from VueJs is really good on the subject. It seems also that setting up server side
rendering brings a lot of constraints, so it should really be motivated by a business case. Nuxt.Js seems very 
interesting as it solves a lot of problems, you'll encounter if you setup server side rendering manually.

## State animations

There was a [demo site](https://state-animations-amsterdam.surge.sh/). The code is available on 
[github](https://github.com/posva/state-animation-demos).  
The same talk is also available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6FPWsPdfuc).

The speaker talked about how we manage animation in VueJs applications. He recommended to read the [key special 
attribute](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#key) documentation as it is used a lot. We should keep in mind that animations should
be fast as it can be boring to see the same animation a lot. We should also use animations when 
* the user is doing something
* we need user's attention
* we want to make things fun

The speaker presented [his library to make animations with VueJs](https://github.com/posva/vue-tweezing). We can also
look at [tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js).

**Takeover :** I never really took time to think about animations in user experience.
