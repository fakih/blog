# [Vue.js Paris #12, authentication and performance tricks](https://www.meetup.com/Vuejs-Paris/events/246008992/)

## [Vue Performance Tricks](http://slides.com/akryum/vue-performance-tricks#/) :heart:

This talk discussed some performance tricks when handling large components or loads of data in a Vue.js application.

### Static tree hoisting

Performance improvement : +  
Already included in Vue.js. It detects parts of your template that does not change and optimize them.  
**Takeover :** Vue is nice to you :smile: 

### [Static binding](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-perf-tests/blob/master/src/components/StaticBindingWith.vue)

Performance improvement : +  
When you apply a class on an element that is not going to change with a condition you can use both `:class` and `class` 
on the element.  
**Takeover :** Do not use dynamic binding everywhere. 

### [Child component caching](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-perf-tests/blob/master/src/components/ChildWith.vue)

Performance improvement : ++  
When you have an heavy component to render which updates often, Vue.js need to recalculate all the component. So sometimes
it is better to put what heavily changes in a component of its own to avoid recalculating heavy parts of the component
which will be cached.  
**Takeover :** Put things that changes often in its own component

### [Local variable](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-perf-tests/blob/master/src/components/LocalVarWith.vue)

Performance improvement : +  
Vue.js adds getter and setter onto computed properties. So each time you access a computed property, you executes theses
getter/setter. Converting props to local variable avoid that.  
**Takeover :** Avoid accessing to much to computed properties.

### [Vuex commit splitting](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-perf-tests/blob/83708cf93733bb220f5f5f03f4beb3ce81db237d/src/store.js#L63-L70)

Performance improvement : 0 (but application reactivity +++)  
When you commit something really big in the store, the app can take several seconds freezing. Breaking the change into
some smaller changes make the app more reactive as it does not freeze in the store update.  
**Takeover :** Split really big commit to store into smaller commits

### [Non reactive data](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-perf-tests/blob/83708cf93733bb220f5f5f03f4beb3ce81db237d/src/store.js#L10-L17)

Performance improvement : +++  
Another trick with change detection with Vue.js. Data that are not going to trigger rerendering when they change should 
not be declared as reactive.  
**Takeover :** Use reactive data only when needed.

### [Virtual scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller)

Performance improvement : +++  
When you have a really long list to display (that goes beyond the screen) you can use this library to render only elements
that are really displayed on the screen. So instead of updating 10 000 components, you only updates the 100 that are 
displayed.  
**Takeover :** Nice lib when you need to handle a bunch of data in a list

**Personal opinion :**
A really good talk about tricks that are not really well known. I'm not sure I understood everything correctly, so when
in doubt, RTFM :wink:
It would be a really good article on medium or a nice part in the Vue.js documentation #justSayin

## Document your Vue components

This talk present a [lib](https://github.com/vuedoc/md) that allow to create documentation from component code.
Basically, you add some comments and annotation and the tool produce a markdown documentation.

**Personal opinion :**
It looks like javadoc for java. It can be useful when you contribute to an open-source component.
Talking about that, the speaker did mention a [vue component library](https://vuecomponents.com/) :+1:

## Vue authentication Handling

The talk explained how to handle authentication in a Vue.js application. Juniors often ask that on twitter/stackoverflow. 
This talk was relatively generic so it can easily be extended to any frontend application. :+1:  
So here some tricks that were discussed :
- Use [promises returned](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/actions.html) by Vuex actions in order to perform redirections
- Do not pass credentials as GET parameters as it is often logged on server side : so prefer POST
- LocalStorage vs Cookies ? Both are vulnerable to exploits [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) 
and [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)). So it depends on your application and 
your needs. (SessionStorage is like LocalStorage)
- Use [axios interceptors](https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors) to add your token to requests, or to handle when 
it is revoked.
- Create a getter to know when you are logged on or not : if your way of handling login change, you don't have impacts
everywhere in your code [(Single responsability principle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
- [Navigation Guards](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/navigation-guards.html) is what your looking for when searching
"Routes restreintes" (FR only)

**Personal opinion :**
A really nice talk. A little too basic sometimes, but it's good to remember basics :wink:
