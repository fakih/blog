## Lightening talks

### Reaction about [OCTO article](https://blog.octo.com/mieux-se-connaitre-pour-mieux-travailler-ensemble-un-imperatif-quand-on-est-developpeur/)

The speaker started explaining where MBTI model come from. It was created by 
[Isabel Briggs Myers](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Briggs_Myers) and 
[Katherine Cook Briggs](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Cook_Briggs). It was based on work of 
[Carl Gustav Jung](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jung) which was exploring psychology at the time the model
was created. [Need sources]
So the question was : can we take a decision based on a model that is not correct?

### [Concept of programming languages](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OK7KDQmrFXlth9qH_po30gow-UKnDI5fArDOMzk7c3E/edit#slide=id.p)

The speaker read the book [Concept, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.fr/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516753271&sr=8-1&keywords=Concepts%2C+Techniques+and+Models+of+Computer+Programming). 
He explained that every language uses some paradigms which come from concepts. So combining concepts and
paradigms you can create  loads of combinations and then languages.

### Tests generation on legacy code

The idea is to create a tool where you define some rules that you don't know if it can be validated by the code or not.
The tool generate tests and tries to validate or invalidate the rules defined. 

### Handling projects which need a specific environment

IE some with java 8 some with java 9...
[NixOs](https://nixos.org/)
[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
=> can allow non regression testing with screen captures !
