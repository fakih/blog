## Lightening talks

### Reaction about [OCTO article](https://blog.octo.com/mieux-se-connaitre-pour-mieux-travailler-ensemble-un-imperatif-quand-on-est-developpeur/)

The speaker started explaining where MBTI model come from. It was created by 
[Isabel Briggs Myers](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Briggs_Myers) and 
[Katherine Cook Briggs](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Cook_Briggs). It was based on work of 
[Carl Gustav Jung](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jung) which was exploring psychology at the time the model
was created. [Need sources]  
So the question was : can we take a decision based on a model that is not correct?

### [Concept of programming languages](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OK7KDQmrFXlth9qH_po30gow-UKnDI5fArDOMzk7c3E/edit#slide=id.p)

The speaker read the book [Concept, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.fr/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516753271&sr=8-1&keywords=Concepts%2C+Techniques+and+Models+of+Computer+Programming). 
He explained that every language uses some paradigms which come from concepts. So combining concepts and
paradigms you can create loads of combinations and then languages.

### Tests generation on legacy code

The idea is to create a tool where you define some rules that you don't know if it can be validated by the code or not.
The tool generate tests and tries to validate or invalidate the rules you defined. 

### Handling projects which need a specific environment

When you have a lot of projects with different languages or different version of a language (for example Java 8 and 
Java 9). It can be hard to maintain a computer with all those environment working at the same time. And for different
version of Java, switching from one project to one other can be difficult.  
There is a solution for that problem : [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv). It allows to have an environment per
folder. You just need to specify a `.envrc` file in the folder. There is a linux distribution based on direnv which is
called [NixOs](https://nixos.org/).  
The speaker discussed with people using direnv for their professional project and their environment is so replicable that
they use end-to-end tests with screen captures. 

## Debates

### TDD outside-in vs inside-out and classicist vs mockist

It was a coaching on the bowling game kata to explain the differences between each approach. I recommend watching 
[this video](https://youtu.be/XHnuMjah6ps) that explain really well Outside-in.  
[That wiki](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Detroit-school-TDD) is also really nice.  
[A nice article](https://8thlight.com/blog/georgina-mcfadyen/2016/06/27/inside-out-tdd-vs-outside-in.html) on the 
subject too.

### Data structures

[Trivia Kata](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia) is nice kata about data structures.
