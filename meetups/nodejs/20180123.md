# [NodeJs Chapitre 05 / Conf√©rence 05 @UrbanLinker](https://www.meetup.com/Nodejs-Paris/events/246931176/)

## From JS to PureScript

After a quick state of the art about statically typed alternative to Javascript, the speaker presented PureScript.
It is an alternative to Typescript which is also statically typed. PureScript is really lightweight and can
interact greatly with Javascript so you can migrate your codebase incrementally.  
[Purescript](https://github.com/sharkdp/insect/blob/master/src/Insect.purs) really looks like 
[Haskell](https://github.com/dojo-developpement-paris/dojo-developpement-paris.github.io/blob/2017-12-15/Banking.hs) 
syntactically. There are some differences with Haskell, like lazy evaluation.  
There is a [book](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) to learn PureScript which is free. And there is a nice
repository about [PureScript documentation](https://github.com/purescript/documentation).

**Personal opinion :**
Really a nice talk to make you want to dig into PureScript. It lacked a small example of code in the talk though.
I could talk with the speaker after the meetup. He actually works with Elm for now, and he said that the main
difference between PureScript and Elm is interoperability with Javascript (which is harder with Elm). Also tooling
with Elm seems really nice. (I really need to dig more).  
Nice meetup to follow too :
- [Meetup Haskell](https://www.meetup.com/haskell-paris/)
- [Meetup Elm](https://www.meetup.com/Meetup-Elm-Paris/)

## How to integrate a legacy module into your codebase

That was a feedback about the [Pix project](https://pix.beta.gouv.fr/projet). To evaluate user, they use smart tests to
avoid asking a lot of questions. They use adaptive scenarios instead of static ones used by other sites. Currently, this
is a research subject. So they had someone that created a python code implementing the algorithm.
Their stack was in Javascript with NodeJs, so making everything work together was hard aside the fact that the algorithm
was impossible to understand for the team.

They decided to integrate that module into their codebase to avoid relying on an external single point of failure.
First, they made a "most valuable product" to validate that the application works. So they had to make NodeJs 
communicate with the **external** python module. Then, they decided to **homogenise** the codebase by asking the 
maintainer to migrate the python script to javascript. Then, they **internalized** the module inside their application. 
Finally, they **modularized** their application using DDD and bounded contexts.

**Takeaways :**
- Ux hide some problems
- Always try to internalise single point of failure
- Do not fear blackboxes (as long as you have a nice test coverage)
- Be transparent with your client (they can understand if you explain your pain points)

**Personal opinion :**
A really cool talk about strategic choice and how to keep your most valuable product working while changing everything 
in your codebase at the same time. :smiley:
